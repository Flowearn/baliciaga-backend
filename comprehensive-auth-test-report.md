### Successes
1. **Registration Flow**: The registration process works correctly with proper form validation
2. **AWS Integration**: Successfully integrated with AWS Cognito for user management
3. **Admin APIs**: Admin confirmation APIs work correctly
4. **Password Authentication**: Login with password authentication is functional

### Issues Identified
1. **Forgot Password Missing**: The "Forgot Password?" link that should be on the login page is not clickable or not properly identified by the test
2. **Password Reset Flow**: Unable to test the complete password reset flow due to missing forgot password functionality

### Technical Details

#### AWS Cognito Configuration
- **User Pool ID**: ap-southeast-1_N72jBBIzH
- **Pool Name**: baliciaga-user-pool-passwordless-dev
- **Region**: ap-southeast-1
- **Authentication Flows**: Password authentication enabled

#### Test Automation
- **Framework**: Puppeteer
- **Approach**: End-to-end UI testing with screenshot capture
- **Admin Operations**: AWS SDK for JavaScript v2

## Recommendations

1. **Fix Forgot Password Link**: Investigate why the "Forgot Password?" link is not accessible in the UI
2. **Update AWS SDK**: Migrate from AWS SDK v2 to v3 as v2 is in maintenance mode
3. **Add Test User Cleanup**: Implement cleanup to remove test users after tests complete
4. **Improve Error Handling**: Add more specific error messages for different failure scenarios

## Test Execution Log
All test steps were documented with timestamps and detailed results in:
- `auth-test-screenshots/test-report.json`

## Conclusion
The authentication system is partially functional with successful registration and login capabilities. However, the password reset functionality needs attention as the "Forgot Password?" link is not accessible during testing. The system correctly integrates with AWS Cognito for user management and supports password-based authentication.
