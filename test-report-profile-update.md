# Baliciaga Profile Update Test Report

## Test Date: 2025-06-22

## Executive Summary
The profile update functionality on the Baliciaga website cannot be fully tested due to critical issues in the authentication flow. The login process fails at the verification code step, preventing access to the profile page.

## Test Environment
- URL: http://localhost:8082
- Test Email: troyzhy@gmail.com
- Test Verification Code: 123456
- Browser: Chromium (via Playwright)
- Frontend Port: 8082
- Backend Ports: 3006, 5747, 5748 (all showing connection refused)

## Detailed Test Results

### Step 1: Homepage Navigation ✓
- Successfully loaded http://localhost:8082
- Page loads with category filters (Food, Bar, Cowork, Rental)
- Content area shows loading skeletons initially, then becomes empty

### Step 2: Login Button Access ✓
- No login button visible in main navigation
- Successfully found hamburger menu icon in top-right corner
- Menu opens when clicked but doesn't contain login option
- Direct navigation to /login path works

### Step 3: Email Entry ✓
- Login page displays correctly with "Sign in" header
- Email input field found and functional
- Successfully entered test email: troyzhy@gmail.com

### Step 4: Send Verification Code ✓
- "Send verification code" button found and clickable
- Button changes to "Sending code..." with loading spinner

### Step 5: Enter Verification Code ❌
- **CRITICAL ISSUE**: No verification code input field appears
- Button remains in "Sending code..." state indefinitely
- No error message displayed to user
- Cannot proceed with authentication

### Steps 6-11: Profile Update ❌
- Could not test due to authentication failure
- Unable to access profile page
- Unable to test name update functionality
- Unable to test WhatsApp update functionality
- Unable to test avatar upload functionality

## Console Errors Detected

1. **Backend Connection Failures**:
   - `Failed to load resource: net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED`
   - Multiple failed requests to:
     - http://localhost:3006/dev/places?type=food
     - http://localhost:5747/ping/stagewise
     - http://localhost:5748/ping/stagewise

2. **API Fetch Errors**:
   - `Error loading data: TypeError: Failed to fetch`
   - Error location: `fetchCafes` function in `cafeService.ts`

## Root Cause Analysis

The profile update issues stem from a complete backend service failure:

1. **Backend Services Not Running**: All backend services (ports 3006, 5747, 5748) are refusing connections
2. **Authentication API Failure**: The send verification code request likely fails silently due to backend unavailability
3. **No Error Handling**: The frontend doesn't display error messages when API calls fail
4. **UX Issue**: Button stays in loading state without timeout or error feedback

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required:
1. **Start Backend Services**: Ensure all backend services are running on ports 3006, 5747, and 5748
2. **Fix Authentication Flow**: Debug why verification code endpoint isn't responding
3. **Add Error Handling**: Display user-friendly error messages when API calls fail
4. **Add Loading Timeout**: Implement timeout for "Sending code..." state with error fallback

### Frontend Improvements:
1. Add proper error boundaries and error states
2. Implement request retry logic with exponential backoff
3. Add connection status indicator
4. Improve loading states with timeouts

### Testing Improvements:
1. Add health check endpoints for all services
2. Implement integration tests for the full authentication flow
3. Add E2E tests that verify backend connectivity before running

## Conclusion
The profile update functionality cannot be tested in its current state due to backend service failures. The authentication system is non-functional, preventing any testing of profile-related features. The primary issue is that backend services are not running or are not accessible at the expected ports.

## Next Steps
1. Verify and start all backend services
2. Confirm API endpoints are correctly configured
3. Re-run tests once backend is operational
4. Document any additional issues found after backend fix
